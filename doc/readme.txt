Execution:

	java -Xmx256m -jar itc2007.jar problem input output [timeout] [seed]

Parameters:

	problem .. problem either ctt, tim, or exam
		ctt for Curriculum based Course Timetabling (track 3)
		tim for Post Enrollment based Course Timetabling (track 2)
		exam for Examination Timetabling (track 1)
	input .. input file
	output .. output file (or folder when an output file is to be saved,
		output file is named input_seed.ext where input is the name
		of the input instance, seed is the random seed that was used
		and ext is the problem specific solution extension (out or sln))
	timeout .. time limit in seconds, optional 
		default is 276 seconds, that is for MacOS X 3GHz server
	seed .. random seed, optional (randomly generated by default)

Additional Options:

	Following options can be passed as Java system variables (-Dvariable=value
	just after java command (e.g., java -Dverbose=info -Xmx256m -jar itc2007.jar ...)

	verbose .. verbose level (none, info, or debug) -- a log file is created in the 
		output folder if verbose level is info or debug

	timeout .. time limit (if not passed as parameter)

	seed .. random seed (if not passed as parameter)

	Example: 
	java -Dseed=12453312 -Dtimeout=445 -Xmx256m -jar itc2007.jar ctt comp01.ctt comp01.out

Notes:

	File input.csv (comma separated values, readable e.g. by Micsoroft Excel)
	is created in the output folder (where input is the name of the input instance).
	After each run, a line is added into this file containing seed, time limit,
	time and iteration in which the best solution was found, value of the
	best solution, and values of problem specific parameters:
		CTT:	rc for room capacity penalty, md for minimum working days penalty, 
			cc for curriculum compactness penalty, and rs for room stability penalty
		TIM:	df for distance to feasibility, pv for violated precedence constraints,
			av for violated slot availabilities,nr for assignments without room,
			1d for one event a day, lt for use of last time of a day,
			3+ for more three or more events consecutively
		EXAM:	bv for binary constraint violations, dc for direct conflicts,
			2r for two exams in a row penalty, 2d for two exams in a day penalty,
			ps for period spread penalty, mx for mixed durations penalty,
			fl for front load penalty, rp for room penalty, and
			pp for period penalty

Requirements:

	Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java SE Development Kit preferably from Sun,
	version 1.5 or later, can be downloaded and installed from http://java.sun.com/

Examples:

	Curriculum based Course Timetabling, 445 seconds time limit, seed 12453312

		java -Xmx256m -jar bin\itc2007.jar ctt data\comp01.ctt comp01.out 445 12453312

	Post Enrollment based Course Timetabling, 350 seconds time limit, no seed

		java -Xmx256m -jar bin\itc2007.jar tim data\comp-2007-2-1.tim comp-2007-2-1.sln 350

	Examination Timetabling, 499 seconds time limit, seed 555
	
		java -Xmx256m -jar bin\itc2007.jar exam data\exam_comp_set1.exam exam_comp_set1.sln 499 555
