Track 1: Examination Timetabling 
<br><br>
The Examination timetabling problem has been widely studied and reported on within the academic literature. This track introduces a practical formulation of the problem which, organisers believe, significantly adds to not only current research but provides a firm basis for future efforts in the area. In addition, it is hoped that the interest generated as part of this competition will lead to the development, investigation and application of a host of novel and exciting techniques not previously trialled within this important real world search domain.
