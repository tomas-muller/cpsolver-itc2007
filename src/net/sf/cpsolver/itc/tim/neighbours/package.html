Track 2 (Post Enrollment based Course Timetabling): Problem Specific Neighbours. 
<br><br>
After student enrollment, the timetable is constructed in such a way that all students can attend the events on which they are enrolled. This approach, which formed the basis of the 2003 competition to course timetabling, has been given various names in the literature including the Class Timetabling Problem and  Event Timetabling.
<br><br>
This track is an extension of the problem model used in the first competition with extra constraints to move further in the direction of real-world timetabling. These extra constraints make finding feasibility more difficult, this means there will be a shift of emphasis from soft constraints to hard constraints.
