International Timetabling Competition 2007: Main Package.
<br><br>
Timetabling within Universities has long been recognized as difficult. Whether it be timetabling exams or courses, much effort is spent producing solutions which are workable and of a high quality.
<br><br>
An important aim of this competition is to generate new approaches to the associated problems by attracting users from all areas of research. As with many cases in the past, significant advancements have been made in research areas by attracting multi-disciplinary approaches.
<br><br>
The second important aim is to close the gap which currently exists between research and practice within this important area of operational research. Although for the sake of the competitive element, we do not include all aspects of the ‘real world’ problem, we do build on the success of the <a href='http://www.idsia.ch/Files/ttcomp2002/'>first international timetabling competition</a> by introducing significantly more depth and complexity.
<br><br>
The competition is composed of three tracks. Although there is much overlap, these tracks represent distinct problems within the area of educational timetabling both from a research and practical perspective. The organizers welcome researchers to trial their techniques on more than one track. 
<br><br>
